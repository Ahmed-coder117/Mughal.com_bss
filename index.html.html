    <h1> Mughal Empire </h1>

    <p> The Mughal Empire was an empire in the Indian subcontinent, established and ruled by a Muslim dynasty of Chagatai Turco-Mongol origin from Central Asia. It was founded in the early 16th century and at its height, it controlled most of the Indian subcontinent, extending from Bengal in the east to Kabul and Sindh in the west, Kashmir in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. </p>
    <p> The Mughal Empire was one of the largest centralized states in pre-modern history and was the precursor to the British Indian Empire. At its height, the empire's power and influence stretched from the Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south, and from the Khyber Pass in the west to Chittagong in the east. </p>
    <p> The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur, a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) on his father's side and from Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother's side. Babur was a direct descendant of Timur through his father, and a descendant also of Genghis Khan through his mother. </p>
    <p> The Mughal Empire was known for its cultural and architectural achievements, including the Taj Mahal, which was built by Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The empire was also known for its administrative efficiency and its promotion of trade and commerce. </p>
    <p> The Mughal Empire declined in the 18th century due to a combination of internal and external factors, including weak rulers, economic decline, and invasions by the Persian ruler Nader Shah and the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani. The empire was finally defeated by the British East India Company in the mid-19th century, leading to the establishment of British rule in India. </p>
    <p> Despite its decline, the Mughal Empire left a lasting legacy in the Indian subcontinent, including its art, architecture, and culture. The empire's influence can still be seen in the region today, and its memory continues to be celebrated in India and Pakistan. </p>
    <p> The Mughal Empire was one of the most powerful and influential empires in the history of the Indian subcontinent, and its legacy continues to be felt to this day. </p>
